What it feels like, kinesthetically and emotionally, to let the body's weight and motion\ngive in to, not resist, the downward-pulling force of gravity.  (\"The more we let go of our physical weight, the more we let go of our emotional weight.\")\n\n2. What it feels like, kinesthetically and emotionally, to use active relaxation as the springboard to vocalizing and moving in a focused forward-directed way.  (\"Go down to go forward.\")\n\n3. What it feels like, kinesthetically and emotionally, to engage the four primary \nemotional articulators of the body - the hands, eyes, and voice - as the primary initiators for meeting a character's objectives. (\"Getting what you want.\")\n\nIn short, Standing Down Straight aligns with Stanislavski's instruction (which he notes in the \"Relaxation\" chapter mentioned above) that acting students remain vigilant about not engaging \"superfluous, harmful tenseness\" or \"tense muscles\" when working.\n\nClasswork will culminate in final projects consisting of a scene, either solo or with a partner, that incorporates the ideas covered in this class, especially those based in the 3 states of kinesthetic and emotional awareness described above under \"About the alignment concept called Standing Down Straight'.\"  In tandem with whatever vocalizations the scene asks for (spoken, sung, non-verbally expressed), the scene will involve, if the text calls for it, the manipulation of an object or objects and moments involving hands-on interactions with your scene partner.   NOTE:  The term \"scene\" can be defined as you wish broadly as you wish.  Here are some options:  \n\n--playwright-written monologues (edited if you wish), or self-written monologues;\n--playwright-written partnered scenes (edited if you wish), or self-written partnered scenes; \n--composer-written songs performed solo (edited if you wish), or self-composed solo-performed songs; \n--composer-written songs with partner (edited if you wish), or self-composed partnered songs; \n--other, outside-the-box, fused voice-movement forms of your own devising, performed either solo or with partner.", "description_id": 135957, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 135957, "description_symbol": "135957_0", "name": "Class Notes"}, {"description": "ISBN:978-0471433347 Abstract Algebra, 3rd ed \nDummit and Foote \nWiley", "description_id": 137444, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137444, "description_symbol": "137444_1", "name": "Class Materials (Required)"}, {"description": "Prerequisite: 291-3; 240 and 300; or consent of department.", "description_id": 137444, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137444, "description_symbol": "137444_2", "name": "Registration Requirements"}, {"description": "ISBN: 978-0387982588 Linear Algebra Done Right (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics), 2nd ed\t\nSheldon Axler\nSpringer", "description_id": 137445, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137445, "description_symbol": "137445_0", "name": "Class Materials (Required)"}, {"description": "Prerequisites: 240 or equivalent; 300 or equivalent.", "description_id": 137445, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137445, "description_symbol": "137445_1", "name": "Registration Requirements"}, {"description": "ISBN: 978-0321500311 Elementary Number Theory, 6th ed\t\nKenneth Rosen\t\t\nPearson", "description_id": 137446, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137446, "description_symbol": "137446_0", "name": "Class Materials (Required)"}, {"description": "Prerequisite: 230.", "description_id": 137446, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137446, "description_symbol": "137446_1", "name": "Registration Requirements"}, {"description": "ISBN: 978-0131816299 Topology, 2nd ed\t\nJames Munkres\t\t\nPearson", "description_id": 137447, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137447, "description_symbol": "137447_0", "name": "Class Materials (Required)"}, {"description": "Prerequisite:320-1 or equivalent.", "description_id": 137447, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137447, "description_symbol": "137447_1", "name": "Registration Requirements"}, {"description": "ISBN: 978-0470458310 Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems, 10th ed\t\nBoyce & DiPrima\t\nWiley\n\nor e-book, ISBN: 978-1118543948", "description_id": 137448, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137448, "description_symbol": "137448_0", "name": "Class Materials (Required)"}, {"description": "Weekly homework and computer projects", "description_id": 137448, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137448, "description_symbol": "137448_1", "name": "Evaluation Method"}, {"description": "Knowledge and use of differentials equations used in a variety of contexts.", "description_id": 137448, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137448, "description_symbol": "137448_2", "name": "Learning Objectives"}, {"description": "Prerequisites: 290-1,2,3 or 291-1,2,3, and 360-1.", "description_id": 137448, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137448, "description_symbol": "137448_3", "name": "Registration Requirements"}, {"description": "ISBN: 978-0132777421 Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives, 8th ed\t\nJohn C Hull\t\t\nPearson", "description_id": 137449, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137449, "description_symbol": "137449_0", "name": "Class Materials (Required)"}, {"description": "No P/N option for this section", "description_id": 132981, "term_id": 4600, "section_id": 132981, "description_symbol": "132981_4", "name": "Class Notes"}, {"description": "Required texts may include: \nThe Essential Guide to Rhetoric.

We will travel from country to country studying son in Cuba, samba in Brazil, tango in Argentina, corrido in Mexico, and vallenato in Colombia, among others, in order to comprehend how certain sounds became emblems of modern nations. We will also navigate the circuits in which certain sounds, such as cumbia, salsa, rock, hip hop, and reggaeton crossed geographic boundaries and evolved into transnational genres that express the collective experience of exile and migration of large populations. We address these histories in an interdisciplinary manner, reading history, anthropology, sociology, and ethnomusicology, and analyzing critically song lyrics, music videos, feature films, and documentaries. The goal is to help students understand why popular music has been a vehicle of nation-state formation in the region. By the end of the course, students should be able to explain how popular music in Latin America figures in struggles over hegemony, socio-economic mobility, and urbanization, as a means of protests and revolt, as a field for developing patterns of consumption for emerging national markets, and as symbolic currency in international negotiations involving issues of representation, legitimacy, and self-determination.", "description_id": 137109, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137109, "description_symbol": "137109_3", "name": "Registration Requirements"}, {"description": "Lecture/discussion/sections", "description_id": 137114, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137114, "description_symbol": "137114_0", "name": "Teaching Method"}, {"description": "Very short papers, medium sized papers, and exams", "description_id": 137114, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137114, "description_symbol": "137114_1", "name": "Evaluation Method"}, {"description": "TBA", "description_id": 137114, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137114, "description_symbol": "137114_2", "name": "Class Materials (Required)"}, {"description": "HISTORY AREA OF CONCENTRATION:  Americas", "description_id": 137114, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137114, "description_symbol": "137114_3", "name": "Class Notes"}, {"description": "4 papers", "description_id": 137115, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137115, "description_symbol": "137115_0", "name": "Evaluation Method"}, {"description": "The readings will be almost entirely chapters and articles posted to Canvas", "description_id": 137115, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137115, "description_symbol": "137115_1", "name": "Class Materials (Required)"}, {"description": "HISTORY AREA OF CONCENTRATION:  Americas", "description_id": 137115, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137115, "description_symbol": "137115_2", "name": "Class Notes"}, {"description": "Four one paragraph long response papers, two five page papers, and a final exam", "description_id": 137116, "term_id": 4610, "section_id": 137116, "description_symbol": "137116_0", "name": "Evaluation Method"}, {"description": "A range of primary and secondary materials including, but not limited to:<br/>\n\nP.T.

By studying ethnographic and fictional narratives about Brazilian indigenous peoples, this course is intended first, to understand the role played by ethnographic accounts in the construction of nationality in Brazil (and in Latin America in general) and, second to understand the role of the imagination in 20th anthropological writing. We will analyze, for example, how the Brazilian lettered elite responded to the image of Brazil that was constructed by Europeans as an exotic space, and how they incorporated it into their projects of nation building (from 19th-century Romanticism to Modernist Avant-gardes and beyond). In addition, we will discuss how indigenous cultures remain a heterogeneous space in the national and global imagination, and the political consequences of this contradiction in contemporary societies. Readings will include travel narratives, novels, poems, essays, ethnographic accounts and films.

Develop an understanding of the role of the researcher in the research process.\n3. Analyze the ethical, moral, and power dynamics inherent in the construction of knowledge.\n4. Develop and apply fieldwork/observation and interviewing skills to generate \"rich,\" high quality data.  \n5. Estimate qualitative data quality and the strengths and weakness of a qualitative research approach overall.\n6. Apply analytical tools to interpret qualitative data.\n7. Identify and synthesize existing theoretical and empirical literatures to build a framework for analyzing original research and to situate original research within an academic dialogue.\n8.

For this purpose\n1) You should ALWAYS read the assigned textbook chapters in advance of the corresponding class. \n2) Optionally: after reading each chapter, send me via e-mail specific topics/subjects of readings that you found especially difficult to grasp or, simply, that you think I should spend substantial time clarifying in class.

Through specific focus on the short story, one of the dominant genres of recent German literary history, students are introduced to some of the major stylistic trends, themes, questions, and motifs of the post-war era. We will examine the development not only of different prose styles, but also an evolution in the themes, issues and questions the literature explores.  The short story genre is particularly well-suited to a course conceived as one of the first literature classes students take in the target language not only because of its relative brevity, but also because of the direct manner in which it employs language and narrative perspective.  \n\nb.  In 200-level courses, students are still working to perfect their language skills, and therefore, this course also serves to strengthen speaking, reading and writing skills through a variety of exercises and approaches.  Each class meeting is speaking intensive, with students given ample opportunity to ask and answer questions. Additionally, small group exercises are developed in which 2-3 students work through a particular passage or series of questions together before presenting them to the group.", "description_id": 132058, "term_id": 4600, "section_id": 132058, "description_symbol": "132058_0", "name": "Learning Objectives"}, {"description": "Course packet will be available at Quartet Digital Printing.", "description_id": 132058, "term_id": 4600, "section_id": 132058, "description_symbol": "132058_1", "name": "Class Materials (Required)"}, {"description": "The class is held entirely IN GERMAN.

A great number of studies have been devoted to understand the nature of syntactic operations and they have been crucially looking at the interaction of these operations with the locality constraints. However, in this direction of research, the nature of islands has been relatively disregarded for a long time. Although Ross's studies have revealed which domains are islands and which are not, the question why islands are islands and non-islands are not islands has remained unanswered except for a few studies (Chomsky 1986, Lasnik & Saito 1992, Rizzi 1991 and others). Even these attempts are facing serious challenges once we start looking at wide varieties of cross-linguistic data.

Development: Once an idea has crystallized, it needs substance. This includes background, research, interviews and the other aspects of investigation that create depth and credibility.\n\n3.

Everybody's continuous participation is encouraged and required. All students are expected to have closely read the assigned texts before the respective sessions and to be prepared to engage in class discussion. Please remember that effective participation also requires good listening skills. Regular attendance is expected of all students.\n\nReading responses (25%)\nStudents are required to post five short critical reflections on the readings during the term. You must post one reading response for each week. All reading responses must be posted on the Blackboard Discussion Board by midnight prior to our seminar meeting. Your response may take the form of questions, reflections, or responses to other students' postings. The postings should be no longer than one sing-spaced page (500 words). You are strongly encouraged to read your colleagues' postings before class. Some questions to consider:\n\n\tHow is the text argued? How does it reach its conclusions?\n\tWhat kind of evidence is presented? Could the evidence be interpreted differently?\n\tHow does the ethnography relate to the theoretical argument?\n\tWhat kind of audience does it seem to be written for? Who is it in dialogue with? \n\tHow do the readings for this session speak to each other? How do they carry on or contrast with a theme from another session?\n\nEthnography of Religion Fieldwork Assignment (60%)\nOver the term you will develop the methodological skills of an anthropologist through fieldwork at a site of your choosing. We will discuss this assignment in class and further details will be posted on Blackboard. The aim is for you to appreciate the process of fieldwork and develop your observation and writing skills. This is an accumulative project that will take you from fieldwork to analysis, to the opportunity to share your findings and receive feedback from classmates. Your analysis of your findings should lead you to your own argument or theory, a process that we will discuss together in class. With each fieldwork assignment, you will submit a field notebook. You are encouraged to plan ahead and assess how you will successfully complete each step in a timely fashion.\n\nTopic (5%) Due Week 2\nObservation (10%) Due Week 4\nInterview/s (10%) Due Week 6\nAnalysis (5%) Due Week 7\nClass Workshop in Week 9 \nConference Presentation (10%) in Week 10\nFinal Paper (20%) due in Exam Week on June 9", "description_id": 141167, "term_id": 4620, "section_id": 141167, "description_symbol": "141167_0", "name": "Evaluation Method"}, {"description": "1) \tFavret-Saada, Jeanne. 1980.

Students should send these questions to\nthe class list no later than 8 am the morning that the class meets.\n2. Critical Review Papers\nOver the course of the semester, students will write two review papers based on the theme of a\nparticular week. In the first paper, the student will analyze the theories and concepts from a set of\nreadings, looking for assumptions or gaps in the literature (Concept paper). In the second paper,\nstudents will examine and critique a methodological approach and/or research design from a set of\nreadings (Methods paper). Papers should be well argued and concise (avoiding summary of readings).\nCritical Review papers should be 5-6 pages (double-spaced).\n3. Research Paper\nStudents will work on developing their research papers over the course of the semester. Papers should\npresent a clear and well-motived research question that addresses themes or debates that we have\ncovered in the class. The paper should also present a clear set of hypotheses and should draw on\noriginal data to support hypotheses. They should be 15-20 pages, due the final day of class.\n4.
