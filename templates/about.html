    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Serif is a web application designed to be the ultimate preparation tool for student schedule preparation at Northwestern. Originally constructed to combat CAESAR's inability to view the shopping cart in a weekly view, Serif is continually being developed to add more features that will help the student experience.</p>
    <p>Serif is not intended to replace CAESAR - the enrollment of courses still must be done in CAESAR itself, not to mention the myriad of other functionality that CAESAR contains that is not related to scheduling (billing, emergency contact, etc). However, Serif should compliment and greatly ease the use of CAESAR for course enrollment, as it will allow students to find courses quickly and easily, create and compare multiple schedules, and more.</p>
    <p>If there is a feature that you would like to see added to Serif, or a functionality that you wish were different somehow, please send a note through the feedback form. This will help Serif become a better service for the students.</p>
